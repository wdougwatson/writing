## @Fulltimegeek Has Had A Ripple Effect

As many may know **@FulltimeGeek** has delegated alot of SP to several people on Steem in a project known as **[Stewards of Gondor](https://steemit.com/static/search.html?q=stewards+of+gondor)**. One of his delegatees, **@Hitmeasap**, has decided to pay it forward and has chosen six people to delegate to. I am honored and completely surprised to be among the **[chosen](/steemit/@hitmeasap/in-a-continued-effort-to-pay-it-forward-i-have-decided-who-i-will-delegate-to)**.

This has brought about some thought and changes on my part. I have not yet received the delegation, me and the others should receive them by February, 2. But I have not waited on making changes. I have reduced the number of faucets I vote on, many of them were low quality posts. I have also lowered the percentage of votes I sell to minnowbooster. I can not in good conscience waste the generosity of **@Hitmeasap**. My new allotment for sale to minnowbooster is 10% so I will always have plenty of VP for upvoting quality posts and comments I find. So far my 10% allotment is still bringing me in ~400 SBD a day, and that is plenty.

In addition to this delegation I have added another lease of 85 SP and will lease a little more to push me over 500 SP fter the delegation is received. I really want to maximize the effect I can have. This delegation is going to be a big help to my **[project](/tloes/@wdougwatson/announcing-the-legion-of-evil-steemians)**

I would like to offer a huge **Thank you** to **@Hitmeasap**, I will do my best to be worthy of it.
