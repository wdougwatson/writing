Like myself **@nexusvortex777** is an agorist and young Steemian who frequently
engages authors by commenting and is seeking to make the world a better
place through voluntary solitions. I don't think it can be said better than
in her own **[inroduction](/freedom/@nexusvortex777/introduce-yourself)**:

>I am a free thinking, freedom minded, liberty living individual. I devote my time and energy to promoting the ideas that support these concepts in my own path, making decisions that align with the ideas of freedom and individual liberty. I love blogging, writing, research, helping others to understand these ideals and live up to them in their choices with interpersonal relationships, family, friends, co-workers, colleagues, and peers.

>Currently, I would consider myself an autodidact, a self learner, and exceptionally, optimistic about the future of innovation and technology. I spend a considerable amount of my time researching cryptography and recently, I began using cryptocurrency. I absolutely love where we are in the present moment with so many ideas coming to surface and avenues we can venture upon to discover our own personal power, evolve as humans and become better stewards of mother Gaia.

>I chose to join steemit because I know there are many people here who carry the same message by living a life that stands for something more than government dependence, statist attitudes, rewarding tyranny and terrorism, and who want to escape the doldrums of a life filled with propagandist media breathing down our necks about the latest fear porn or Deep State contrived psychological operation. I want to connect with other freedom loving individuals who are serious about creating and implementing concrete solutions that actually work.

If that doesn't sound like someone you need to **[follow](/@nexusvortex777)**
you might be a statist!

We will now begin the hard work of actually building this thing from the
ground up and I am glad to have someone to brainstorm and work with.
