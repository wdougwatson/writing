In a previous **[post](/delegation/@wdougwatson/being-chosen-and-a-general-update)** I told you all about **@hitmeasap** picking me to be among the chosen ones. Since that time this has actually turned into a pretty ambitious project.

## What The Hell Is An #ASAPER You Ask? 

We are a group of young Steem super heroes with a funny name.

Seriously though, **@hitmeasap** was inspired by the generosity of **@fulltimegeek** and decided to pay it forward and begin making his own delegations. **#Asapers** is a project to make a difference in young Steemians lives and help them make a difference on Steem and in the real world.

So like I said, super heroes.
