As many may know **@FulltimeGeek** has delegated alot of SP to several people on Steem in a project known as **[Stewards of Gondor](https://steemit.com/static/search.html?q=stewards+of+gondor)**. One of his delegatees, **@Hitmeasap**, has decided to pay it forward and has chosen six people to delegate to. I am honored and completely surprised to be among the **[chosen](/steemit/@hitmeasap/in-a-continued-effort-to-pay-it-forward-i-have-decided-who-i-will-delegate-to)**.

This has brought about some thought and changes on my part. I have not yet received the delegation, me and the others should receive them by February, 2. But I have not waited on making changes. I have reduced the number of faucets I vote on, many of them were low quality posts. I have also lowered the percentage of votes I sell to minnowbooster. I can not in good conscience waste the generosity of **@Hitmeasap**. My new allotment for sale to minnowbooster is 10% so I will always have plenty of VP for upvoting quality posts and comments I find. So far my 10% allotment is still bringing me in ~.400 SBD a day, and that is plenty.

In addition to this delegation I have added another lease of 85 SP and will lease a little more to push me over 500 SP after the delegation is received. I really want to maximize the effect I can have. This delegation is going to be a big help to my **[project](/tloes/@wdougwatson/announcing-the-legion-of-evil-steemians)**.

I would like to offer a huge **Thank you** to **@Hitmeasap**, I will do my best to be worthy of it.

## I Took The Weekend Off

I have been pushing myself pretty hard lately between my job and Steem and since I had the weekend off from work I took a break of sorts from Steem too. I was still on here but I wasn't worrying about writing a post at all. I just read blogs that I enjoy and made a comment here and there.

I really needed to relax so I just took the weekend to enjoy myself. I really enjoy Steem but I don't ever want it to feel like a job. When I need downtime, it is probably best to just take it if I can.

## The Week Ahead

My job requires that I work rotating shifts. One week I work nights, the next I'm on evenings, then to days. Rinse, repeat. It might seem counter intuitive but days is actually the worst week for me energy wise because the other two shifts screw up my sleeping pattern. As I'm sure you have guessed, I'm on days this week.

I don't know how many posts I'll get done this week. Since becoming active on Steem my week of days has had the lowest post/comment count. This week I will attempt to combat this by splitting my writing time between mornings and evenings, as I have done with this post. I do find myself having greater motivation since beginning to work on **@tloes** so I may do better, but days are a mother fucker for me.

In other news, I received a belated birthday present from a long time friend. I have six hits of yellow microdot LSD. Currently me and two friends are planning to dose this Saturday night. I intend to try and document as much as possible if the acid will let me. Hopefully there should be a post or a video about it some time next week.

## Conclusion

Thanks for taking the time to read my post. If you have any suggestions or feedback about any of this please hit me up in the comments. In particular let me know what you think of an LSD trip report. Peace!
