I recently read a **[post](/personalfinance/@heymattsokol/personal-finance-update-paying-off-fiat-debts-is-the-antifragile-way)** by **@heymattsokol** that got me thinking seriously about financial issues. He regularly blogs about his finances and lately Steem has been a big help to him. Unlike many of us he takes an accurate accounting of his net worth and he admits to being several thousand dollars in the hole. Due to Steem he is making serious strides towards a net worth of zero. Obviously this is just a short term goal and he wants to be rich like the rest of us.

In the comments we had the following exchange:

Obviously we all know that accumulating SP is important for success here on Steem. I've stated previously that II have big plans for my future on Steem. These plans all hang on my ability to accumulate SP. I think this has time to ask myself some questions.

## What are my long term goals with regards to SP?

I don't mean something silly like I want 3 million SP. I do want 3 million SP but that is not practical as a goal right now. I want a minimum of 5,000 SP. That will put me in the dolphin category and on my way to serious earnings. The dolphin category ranges between 5000-15000 so 5000 is the minimum long term goal for me right now.

## What is the window that Matt spoke of?

Right now SBD prices are high and we don't know how long they will remain that way. The market could correct, witnesses could decide to take action to push SBD back down, any number of things could happen. This means that I have a finite window to accumulate larger chunks of SP for my efforts here on Steem. Furthermore I have no way of knowing when this window will close. If it closes it will delay my goal of reaching dolphin.

## How should this window affect my actions in the short term?

I need to evaluate my earnings so far. I need to do every thing I can to maximize them. I need to explore all possible ways of accumulating SP. I might have to delay some other plans until I can realistically afford to fund them.

## What are my current Steem income streams?

I earn daily from blogging, commenting, and curating, my earnings fluctuate a good bit but lately have been about 15 SBD and 2.5 SP a week. I sell 10% of my VP to minnowbooster and earn between .250-.450 SBD a day. I have a small delegation to @randowhale and earn .018-.025 SBD a day. I have another small delegation to dmania but currently I haven't earned anything there yet.

## That isn't much, what am I going to do about it?

One thing I intend to do is lease more SP. I realize this will cut into the whole powering up thing but it will also increase my daily earnings from curating and what I make from my own upvote on posts I write. In theory, it should help me earn more from minnowbooster too. Though, that depends on what votes my account is used for. I also intend to delegate more to @randowhale. If I lease an additional 1000 SP I will be able to delegate more of my own out thus netting a grater percentage. I would like to say I intend to write more but I'm currently at maximum capacity there. I just don't have the time. I might try to work on getting some posts stockpiled so I can increase post frequency once I have a good many in the hole. My last idea is also from **@heymattsokol**. I intend to start another account and use it for microblogging/memes. I think dmania, decentmemes, and zappl could be a gold mine but I don't want to pollute my stream for people who aren't into that kind of content. 

Edit: I began working on this post a little while ago. In the middle of it I took a break and tried out decentmemes for the first time. Check out my first post fom there: **[Tell Me Not To Hodl](/decentmemes/@wdougwatson/decentmemes-1517363659418)**. Looks like I need to make that second account pretty soon.

## Conclusion 

If you have any other ideas concerning how to increase my SP or if you see something I am missing please let me know in the comments. Also, are you interested in these kinds of post in the future? Do you wanna hear about my finances and my quest for dolphin status? Thanks for stopping by and reading my blog. Let's help each other grow!
