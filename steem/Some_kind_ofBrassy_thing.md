In My last **[post](https://steemit.com/dsound/@wdougwatson/playing-with-fruity-loops)** I released a short clip I had worked on while following several tutorials. Today I have something a little longer. It is a complete song, though it is a short one.

## About The Song

I am love **[Synthwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave)** and would like to start producing it on a regular basis. This song doesn't quite fit into the Synthwave category and seems closer to **[Italo-disco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_disco)** to me. But then, genre classifications are always confusing to me. **Who really cares?...**

## Proudction and Plugins

For me the most notable thing about this song is the dirty busted sounding 1980s drum samples. The kick was created by layering three kick samples from **[80s Retro Drummer](http://www.zenhiser.com/80s-retro-drummer.html)** by Zenheiser. The snare also came from 80s Retro Drummer. I love this pack and can't recommend it enough. The hi-hat is one that came included with FL Studio.

The bass line was created with the Sytrus plugin which is included FL. The preset used "deep bass". This was my first time using the plugin and I really liked it.

The brassy sounding lead was made with Nexus by **[REFX](https://refx.com/)**. I had expected to have to look for a preset or do alot of knob tweaking but fortunately I didn't have to touch a thing. I used the default setting, "Saw Init"

After sending each instrument to its own mixer track I used Fruity Parametric EQ 2 to make room for each instrument's sound range. Finally I did some manual volume limiting to prevent clipping

## Conclusion

I hope to make much more music and to continually improve. I of course will continue writing regular posts but music is something that I love, so I really want to contribute more of this kind of content. I'd be interested in feedback and any helpful hints you might have.
