I recently started a Steem project that in a silly moment, I decided to call **[The Legion of Evil Steemians](/tloes/@wdougwatson/announcing-the-legion-of-evil-steemians)**. At this point people could ask some valid questions. In this post I hope to explain my reasoning.

## Why Be Evil

The name was chosen, as I said above, in a silly moment. I have quite a few of those and I generally just roll with it. As stated in the original **[announcement post](/tloes/@wdougwatson/announcing-the-legion-of-evil-steemians)**:

> The name is an homage to The Legion of Doom from the old **[Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends)** cartoon from the 80s. We will not actually be evil.

Silly, I know. If you have trouble having fun and being silly I recommend you watch more **[Zefrank](http://www.zefrank.com/)**. Here is something to get you started.

## What Do You Plan To Accomplish
**TL;DR version: This one weird trick will make you an anarchist!**

Like everyone else on Steemit, I plan on getting rich. I'm betting that after that whole giant baby interlude you think I'm just being silly again, but you are wrong. I'm an **[agorist](http://www.agorist.org/)**. I believe in trying to find voluntary solutions to most all problems in life. One of the best tools we have for finding these solutions is the market. A fair exchange of goods and services between parties. In any market it helps to know what people are looking to buy. Here on Steem the biggest market is service to the community itself. That is what I am offering.

Some people don't realize it, but **Steem is anarchist money**. We are functioning on a free and open market here. Some might claim it isn't free because of whale abuse but that is a subject for another time. My point is that this is an anarchic system but people don't realize it. We all come here from the exact opposite system. The master/slave system. From that reference point an actual free market might be a bit confusing. I intend to alleviate that confusion by promoting anarchist content. This is a service to Steem, a service to the anarchist community, and a service to the world. That is the service trifecta folks.

I also intend to create new anarchist and I'm going to do it by helping newbies to get paid on Steem. They just don't understand this whole voluntary exchange thing. They don't understand that they here to trade. What most creators want more than anything is engagement, and newbies just don't understand that. Engagement takes effort. "Nice post sir, very inspiring", is not engagement.These people need to be shown the ropes. Me and my cohorts are going to do that. While we do that we will attempt to plant the seeds of anarchy in their soul.

## Why Now

I currently have 112 SP. Why oh why would I start this project when I am such a newbie myself?

**TL;DR version: It is never too early to begin conquering the world!**

The best reason is that I am the kind of person who thrives on a project. I need mental stimulation or I begin to get lethargic. I have battled depression all my life and the best way I have found to combat it is to find things I enjoy and throw myself into them. As soon as I got involved in Steem I got that charge. I could feel that this community of communities on the Steem blockchain was something that I could really get into. However I am not satisfied with that, I want to magnify it!

Another good reason is it will give me something to write about. When you write it helps if you give a shit about the subject. Securing my personal freedom and helping others do the same is something that matters a great deal to me. One thing I hate to do as a writer is write about writing. It just feels too meta. But most writers inevitably end up doing just that. I think the main reason is that it is something that they care about and spend a good deal of time doing. Having other work to do will help me avoid that to some degree.

I am not content to sit on the sidelines. For centuries humanity has marched steadily towards freedom. That is until the first part of the Twentieth century. Some progress was made but the pace has slowed to a crawl and sometimes seems to be moving backwards. There are people out there who are fighting tyranny and they need all of our help. I have a family and a job, I can't lead the resistance. I can however do something. I can write. I can promote other creators. I can try to lend financial support to those in the trenches.

Lastly, there are quite a few worthy projects on Steem. It seems like there is one for everything. From helping the poor to sponsoring open source software development, there seems to be a project for every need. I simply don't have the inclination to get involved in most of them or learn the ins and outs of how they work. By working on a project that I help create and build up I will have the opportunity to help these other worthy projects the old fashioned way, I can give them a check. Well, it won't really be a check, but you get the idea.

## No More Questions! 

Just kidding. But for now these are the questions I could think to answer. Hopefully you can help me out though. What else would you like to know? Please ask away in the comments. Maybe you have some ideas. I'd love to hear them. I have told a couple people already that this is not my project. I thought of it, sure. I'm happy to bask in the glory of that. But I can't do much on my own. This project will belong to all those who contribute to it. So please, contribute. If you have something you would like to discuss related the project but don't wish to do so in the comments look me or @NexusVortex777 up on discord. Be advised that we both have full schedules so it may take a bit for one of us to get back to you.
