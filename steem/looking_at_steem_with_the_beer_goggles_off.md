I am a very young steemian and until today I have been really excited about Steem. When I first got active here I drank the cool-aid. I may have had too much. I mean there are many great people and communities here. Steem is a fantastic place to engage with others and share ideas. There is also something else here. Something dark. Something rotten. It makes me question my intentions here.

I lifted these images from this **[post](/@eosgo/eos-telegram-summary-2-3-18-new-dapp-confirmed-for-eos)** by **@eosgo**. You can read more about the incident there.

## There Were Already Problems With Steemit

There have been whale wars and allegations of reward pool rape. There are spammers in every comment section. There is endless contention about bid bots. This is just a partial list. Everything I mentioned here, I was ignoring. I chalked it up to growing pains. I mean hell, this is the wild west right? And you know what? I still feel that way. This other issue is something different though.

I posted this from my **[microblog](/@wdwmemesnzapps)** account.

## The Robber Barons Are Here

This is a decentralized system but some people have quite a bit of pull. **@ned** has more than most. What happened here goes against everything that we are told this place is about. I get that there may be bad blood here. I get that @ned might feel threatened by EOS. I'm honestly pretty sad at this blatant display of the scarcity mindset in action.

This is the thing that has the world enslaved. This is the thing that empowers the elite and starves the poor. Worse still, this is the thing in the driver's seat of Steemit inc.

## What Does This Mean For Me?

I obviously plan on staying here. I still plan to engage with other creators. I still plan to work on the projects I'm involved with here. I have met some great people here and I don't plan on walking away from the relationships I have tried to cultivate. That being said, I have lost faith in the leadership here.

I intend to diversify my holdings more. I no longer think Steem is **THE** answer. I ain't drinken' your cool-aid anymore dude.

I am going to be more aggressive in my posting schedule. I have multiple accounts to post from and intend to use them all. Abusing the system you say? Scroll back up.

What is my incentive to play nice? This is how the big dogs play. Apparently the spammers had it right all along.

Thanks for reading my little one sided diatribe until the end. There will be more soon. Much more.
